Project structure:

Classes:

    Controller: Handles input and output from the GUI.
    Handles button presses, getting any text fields, as
    well as displaying and updating the text fields.

    Handler: Reads a line from the MIPS file and updates the
    memory and registers.

    Main: Responsible for launching the JavaFX Window

Microcode steps:

    Load operation:

    Store operation:

    add (ex. add $t0, $t1, $t2):
    - send $t1 to the alu
    - send $t2 to the alu
    - alu performs addition (hardware circuit)
    - alu stores the 32-bit result in $t0
    - set condition code
    - $pc = $pc + 4 // advance the program counter by 4 bytes

    subtract (ex. sub $t0, $t1, $t2):
    - send $t1 to the alu
    - send $t2 to the alu
    - alu performs subtraction (hardware circuit)
    - alu stores the 32-bit result in $t0
    - set condition code
    - $pc = $pc + 4 // advance the program counter by 4 bytes

    multiply (ex. mult $t0, $t1):
    - send $t0 to the alu
    - send $t1 to the alu
    - alu performs multiplication (hardware circuit)
    - alu stores the 64-bit result in $mflo and $mfhi
    - set condition code
    - $pc = $pc + 4 // advance the program counter by 4 bytes

    AND:

    OR:

    NOT:

    XOR:

    jal (ex. jal 5000):
    - store the value of $pc in $ra
    - set $pc to 5000
